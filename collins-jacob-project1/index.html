<p>Horror is a film genre seeking to elicit a negative emotional reaction from viewers by playing on the audience's primal fears. 
Inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, Mary Shelley, horror films have for more than a century 
featured scenes that startle the viewer. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Thus they may overlap with the 
fantasy, supernatural, and thriller genres.</p>

<p>Horror films often deal with the viewer's nightmares, hidden fears, revulsions and terror of the unknown. Plots within the horror 
genre often involve the intrusion of an evil force, event, or personage, commonly of supernatural origin, into the everyday world. 
Prevalent elements include ghosts, aliens, vampires, werewolves, demons, gore, torture, vicious animals, evil witches, monsters, 
zombies, cannibals, and serial killers. Conversely, movies about the supernatural are not necessarily always horrific.</p>

<ol>
<li>Action Horror</li>
